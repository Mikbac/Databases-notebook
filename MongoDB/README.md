# MongoDB

General purpose document database.

* MongoDB database stores data in collections (database is a container for collections).
* A collection holds one or more BSON documents.
* Document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB.

BSON is the binary representation of JSON that supports data types unavailable in JSON.

The maximum BSON document size is 16 mebibytes. To store documents larger than the maximum size, MongoDB provides the
GridFS API.
